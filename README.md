PATCH - Updating System is a rock-solid, professional, smart and clean solution to manage and distribute updates for your games and applications.

Your players can finally update the game with no pain or headaches, without having to download the whole game again when a new version comes. This will save them a lot of bandwidth and time!

It is fully compatible with .NET Core, so it can run on all desktop platforms .NET Core can run on. Mobile platforms are currently NOT supported. It comes with implementations for Unity, WPF, WinForms and commandline.

Main features
- patches are generated by a binary diffing algorithm
- strong patches compression
- corrupted/modified files repairing
- files attributes synchronization
- fully customizable UI
- no server-side code required: a normal HTTP server is enough
- sequential and non-sequential patches processing
- shortest path calculation for updates
- detection of very old versions with full-repair triggering
- self-update functionality

Admin tools
- versions management
- patches management
- launcher updates management
- CI/CD friendly thanks to a commandline tool
